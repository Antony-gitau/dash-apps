# dash-apps

In this repo, I followed an [article](https://realpython.com/python-dash/) to practise creating a dash application.

The dataset is from Kaggle, [Avocado dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/neuromusic/avocado-prices). 

See the screenshot of [graph1](https://github.com/Antony-gitau/dash-apps/blob/main/Graph1.png)
